## Development

### Run app

1. Clone repo ```git clone https://github.com/imshubhamsingh/PhoneBook.git```
2. ```npm install && start  ```


### Instructions

__You need [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php) installed on your machine__

Since the app uses SQLite library and PDO , it is not included by default, it is necessary to modify the PHP.INI file in the directory of PHP and activate one line, by removing the semicolon in prefix: 

```extension=php_pdo_sqlite.dll ```


For more information about PDO, please visit http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php.
